# NST
Features:
    
   - This tool has the ability to evaluate mathematical expressions with multiple number systems in the same expression.
   - This tool also has the ability to convert from one base system to the other. 

####  Calculator

----------

##### Number System ID's.
 * To calculate an expression, you'll type the expression in the input field. Then select the preferred number system for output. Then hit calculate.

 * These are are entered on the edge of each number. 

 * Any number without a identifier  will be treated as a Base 10 Number.)

**Identifiers:**
    
    - b       (Binary)
    - h       (Hexadecimal)
    - o       (Octal)
 
_As an example, (11001b) would be treated as a Binary number in the expression._

#### Convert
* To convert between number systems, enter a number to convert. Then select the starting base system, then select the target system and hit convert. 

#### Graphical User Interface
(Revamp coming soon!)
